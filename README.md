## Role Variables

A list of all the default variables for this role is available in `defaults/main.yml`.

## Usage

This is an example playbook:

```yaml
---

- hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: amtega.netbackup
      vars:
        netbackup_state: present

        netbackup_server: myserver.acme.com
        netbackup_media_servers:
          - mymediaserver1.acme.com
          - mymediaserver2.acme.com

        netbackup_certificate_fingerprint: >-
          xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

        netbackup_authorization_token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Testing

Tests are based on [molecule with docker containers](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

The tests doesn't install the netbackup packages to avoid registering into servers testing machines.
To run test you need provide the variables defined in `defaults/main.yml`. One way to provide this information is calling the testing playbook passing an additional inventory using the following environment variables:

- `ANSIBLE_INVENTORY`: path to an inventory
- `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE`: path to the file containing the vault password required for the previous inventory

```shell
cd amtega.netbackup

ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=~/myinventory ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/myvaultpassword molecule test --all
```
